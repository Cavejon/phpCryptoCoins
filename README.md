CryptoCoins - Cryptocurrency Information and Real-Time Quotes
The "CryptoCoins" project is an academic endeavor developed as part of the degree in Analysis and Systems Development. Its primary objective is to provide users with comprehensive information about cryptocurrencies, including popular ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum, while also allowing them to monitor real-time cryptocurrency prices. To achieve this goal, a combination of various technologies was employed in the development process:

Technologies Used
HTML
HTML serves as the backbone of the page, creating the structure and content for the platform. It's responsible for rendering everything from headers and paragraphs to search forms and data tables, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

Bootstrap
The Bootstrap framework was utilized to enhance the design and appearance of the page. It provides pre-designed components and styles that make it easy to create a responsive and visually appealing layout. This ensures that the page remains accessible and visually appealing across devices of different sizes.

MySQL
The MySQL database management system plays a crucial role in storing and managing cryptocurrency-related information, including price history, market data, and other relevant statistics. It provides a robust and efficient means of data storage and retrieval.

PHP
PHP, a server-side scripting language, is used to create the back-end logic of the page. It allows for data retrieval from the database, processing, and dynamic presentation to users. Additionally, PHP can interact with third-party APIs to access real-time cryptocurrency data, enabling users to stay updated on market trends.

jQuery
The jQuery JavaScript library enhances interactivity on the page. It can be utilized to create features such as dynamic charts, real-time updates of market information, and overall improvements to the user experience.

Project Objective
The "CryptoCoins" page is designed to provide users with an informative and practical platform for tracking the latest news and cryptocurrency quotes. The user-friendly interface and responsive design, facilitated by HTML, Bootstrap, MySQL, PHP, and jQuery technologies, ensure that users have a seamless experience while exploring the world of cryptocurrencies.

Whether you're a student, a crypto enthusiast, or someone looking to stay updated on the cryptocurrency market, "CryptoCoins" is your go-to source for valuable information and real-time insights. We hope you find this project both educational and engaging.
